Outstanding Issues

- We have a potential problem with the initialization process.  Currently, we have a check_init table that has no entries and two possible default actions: init and no_op.  During normal operation the default action is no_op, and when the operator wants to trigger reinitialization, he changes the default action to init.  The problem is keeping initialization under control: we only want to execute initialization once, but it is triggered by the arrival of a packet in the dataplane, and while the switch initializes, other packets could arrive before we have a chance to revert the default action in the control plane.

How might we change this to ensure initialization happens only once?

We could use two registers and form a semaphore.  Assume both registers must be true in order to carry out initialization.  During normal operation, reg A is set to true and reg B is set to false.  Check_init default action is no_op until controller changes it to set_reg_B_true.  The first action taken by the intialization action is to set reg A to false.  The last actions taken by the intialization action is to set reg B to false and then set reg A to true.  Meanwhile, all subsequent packets should be held somehow (recirculated?) while reg B is true.

Double check this solution with existing semaphore implementations e.g. Peterson's Algorithm or Dekker's algorithm.
