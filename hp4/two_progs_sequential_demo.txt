INSTRUCTIONS FOR P1 -> P1' DEMO

P1 is a simple L2 switch.  P1' is just like P1, except that it also uses an extra
table that drops traffic matching specified destination MACs.  For this demo,
the dest MAC for 'h3' is the sole entry in this table.

Conceptually, this demo:
1) Brings up HyPer4 as a clean slate in a mininet simulation, single switch topology
   with hosts h1, h2, and h3 connected to it (HyPer4 CLI accessible via port 22222)
2) Populates HyPer4 with the entries necessary to emulate P1
3) Populates HyPer4 with the entries necessary to emulate P1'
4) Completes setup, initializing HyPer4 to 'run'/emulate P1
5) Shows connectivity between h1<->h2 and h1<->h3
6) Changes HyPer4 over to P1' (traffic to h3 now blocked)
7) Shows connectivity to h3 disrupted
8) Changes HyPer4 back to P1 (P1 has no blocking functionality)
9) Shows connectivity to h3 restored

Let's begin.  Open two terminals.

In the first terminal:
cd [path]/hp4-src/hp4
./run_demo.sh

Now, in the second terminal:
cd [path]/hp4-src/hp4
./run_cli.sh 22222 < targets/two_progs_sequential/p1.txt
./run_cli.sh 22222 < targets/two_progs_sequential/p1prime.txt
./run_cli.sh 22222 < targets/two_progs_sequential/setup.txt

Back in the first terminal:
mininet> h1 ping h2 -c 2
mininet> h1 ping h3

In the second terminal:
./run_cli.sh 22222 < targets/two_progs_sequential/swap_to_p1prime.txt

In the first terminal, observe that pings between h1 and h3 stop.

In the second terminal:
./run_cli.sh 22222 < targets/two_progs_sequential/swap_to_p1.txt

In the first terminal, observe pings between h1 and h3 resume.
[ctrl-c, exit]
