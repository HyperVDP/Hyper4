Using HLIR in Python

In Python, do these things:

from p4_hlir.main import HLIR
h = HLIR("hp4.p4")
h.build(analyze=False)

The second line should be modified with the correct path for hp4.p4 as
necessary.

The argument for the build function in the third line is important to shut off
table dependency analysis, which for HyPer4 could take who knows how long,
because we have never done it successfully.  Complexity analysis based on
steadily increasing the number of tables in a test P4 project and measuring the
amount of time required to do the analysis suggests that for HyPer4 this could
take many days.
